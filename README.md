Simple mod that allows the player to light cigarettes when standing near a lit campfire.

### ABOUT

A simple mod that allows the player to light cigarettes when standing near a lit campfire. It also allows the burner anomaly in the stove, at the Army Warehouses to light cigarettes.

If other addons add new tools to light cigarettes, the order in which tools is semi-random. If the player has matches, these will always be used first.
